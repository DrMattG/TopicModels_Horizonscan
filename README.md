# TopicModels_Horizonscan

This repository is the begining of a project that will be entitled "HorizonScanR". We will develop an R package that allows automation of some aspects of horizon scanning. 

## Topic modelling to find important themes in the literature

Using search results from Web of Science (.bib files) we can make use of revtools to do LDA topic modelling of the titles, abstracts and keywords. Then taking the output from revtools we can look at the trend in each of the topics identified in the model.
